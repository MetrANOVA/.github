# Vision 
In the future, The Consortium acts as a team supporting those engaged in network measurement and analysis endeavors within the Research and Education (R&E) community. As a result of our efforts to achieve the stated goals below,  the following will be true:
- Networks employ data-driven design and operations to make the most of their investment
- Engineers have supportable tools, techniques, and tactics to execute effectively
- A collaboratively developed and sustainable technical ecosystem exists that supports a diversity of needs. 
- both large, well-funded, and modest-scale networks can leverage our efforts
- An ecosystem based on Open and loosely coupled architectures without dependency on cloud services will exist.
- While encouraging innovation, production-ready building blocks and design patterns will facilitate quality services.
- The Consortium will leverage expertise from invested organizations and individuals to advance the collectiveâ€™s network measurement goals more effectively together than apart.

## Goals:
- Provide tools, tactics, and techniques to the community
  - Develop and share open architectures, technical components, design patterns, best practices, and policy recommendations to create effective network measurement systems.
 
- Facilitate the ability to generate multi-data source composite views of R&E cyberinfrastructure.
  - Educate the R&E community to enable effective use of network measurements for operations, engineering, planning, and outreach.
  - Create learning and growth opportunities for students and staff
  - As appropriate, coordinate with other community and industry efforts
  - Providing the technical and policy primitives to support controlled sharing

## Non-Goals:
- Creating production services or federation of services
-- Given the sensitivity of measurement data and the complex needs of each Member Organization, it is left to Members to consider how they will address their own needs. Some Members might offer measurement services to other institutions. Others might have private services. The Consortium does not constrain the business models of its Members.
-- Providing the technical and policy primitives to support controlled sharing confidently is in scope; the actual sharing of data via provided primitives is not.
