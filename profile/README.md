### About
MetrANOVA is a neutral, trusted, and open consortium for **A**dvancing **N**etwork **O**bservation, **V**isualization, and **A**nalysis. Its primary goal is to advance the state of Research and Education Networking(REN) measurement and analysis by developing and socializing technical capabilities. Success comes from member organizations and the broader community using these capabilities publicly and privately within their infrastructure. To avoid competing against stakeholders' interests, the Consortium will focus on developing tools, tactics, and techniques but will not offer measurement services. However, Member Organizations and the broader community  are encouraged to use these tools, tactics, and techniques to create appropriate local, distributed, and federated solutions.

This Consortium will focus on three types of deliverables:
- Develop and share open architectures, technical components, design patterns, best practices, and policy recommendations to create effective network measurement systems.
- Educate the R&E community to enable effective use of network measurements for operations, engineering, planning, and outreach.
- Provide growth opportunities for students and staff.

The Consortium will consist of both Member Organizations and Affiliates (individuals or organizations) that are actively participating in the project.  The set of individual participants who are contributing to the project are considered Contributors. A tiered participation model will allow for different levels of resource allocation and commitment to the project, enabling a broad base of Contributors. The final decision-making responsibility for the project’s direction resides with an Executive Committee. The Executive Committee consists of one individual from each of the participating Member Organizations.
